## 2. Data Collection and Use

We do **not** collect, store, or share any of your personal data.

When you interact with this assistant:

## 3. Third-Party APIs

To generate responses, this assistant may access public APIs (e.g., the [Official Joke API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api)).

These APIs:
